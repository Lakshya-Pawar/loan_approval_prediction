# Loan Approval Prediction

## Overview
This project involves predicting the approval status of loan applications based on various applicant features. The goal is to determine whether a loan application will be approved or not.

## Steps
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzed datasets to understand its structure and features.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created and modified features for better model performance.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Encoded categorical variables, scaled features, and split data into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Building**: Trained regression models (e.g., Linear regression, Random Forest regression).

## Requirements
- Python 3.11-3.12
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Files
- `loan_approval_prediction.ipynb`: Main jupyter notebook for data analysis and preprocessing.
- `test_df.ipynb`: jupyter notebook for data cleaning of test dataset.
- `formulated_test.csv`: Prepared test dataset for loan approval prediction.
